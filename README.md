# JavaScript Fundamentals

**[AlbanyCanCode Course](https://albanycancode.org/)**

**Fall 2019**

This is the git repository for the class. It will be updated on a class by class basis.

You will submit your assignments by doing pull requests. You will need to create a Github account if you do not have one already. Fork this repository by clicking on the _Fork_ button. Then clone your forked repository with this command, replacing YOUR-USERNAME with your Github username:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/JavaScriptFundamentals2019.git
```

Add the original repository as a remote to your forked repository:

```bash
cd JavaScript2019
git remote add upstream https://github.com/AlbanyCanCodeCourses/JavaScriptFundamentals2019.git
git fetch upstream master
```

At any point, if you see the message "Please tell me who you are" in your command line output, you will need to setup your command line to use your Github account. Follow the instruction underneath where it says "Run", replacing "youremail@example.com" and "Your Name" with your information.

#### On Making Pull Requests

Whenever you are ready to submit your work, commit your changes and push to your forked repository.

```bash
git push origin master
```

Follow the guide [Creating a pull request from a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/) to make a pull request. The "original repository you created your fork from" that the guide refers to in Step 1 is the AlbanyCanCodeCourses's repository.
