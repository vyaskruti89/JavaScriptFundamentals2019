 * Loop through a nested array of people. For each person in the array,
 * format and return a string of marketing demographics about each person.
 * You will be getting the data from:
 * @see /challenges/10-7-challenges/people.json
 *
 * @param {array} people an array of nested objects, where each object
 * contains information about a person. It's each object in this file:
 * @see /challenges/10-7-challenges/people.json
 *
 * @returns {string} string in CSV format that you can be saved and then opened in Excel, Numbers
 * or another spreadsheet program. This means that you are going return a very large string,
 * where pieces of information will be separated with new line characters (\n), commas and quotes.
 * The first line should contain labels like this: "Name","Gender","Location","DOB"\n
 * Then each following line will represent a single person, with the data about that person:
 * @example
 * "Name","Gender","Location","DOB"\n"Georgia Wagner","female","Skookumchuck, VA","1977-02-26"\n"Meredith Holt","female","Coltman, WV","1957-09-22"\n"Cora Bradley","female","Fairland, GA","1995-07-19"\n"Carol Scott","female","Two Brooks, WI","1973-08-17"\n"Vincent Silva","male","Brookhaven, DC","1959-07-30"\n"Clifton Armstrong","male","Cimarron, WA","1971-10-08"\n"Deanna Stanley","female","Morgan Mill, OK","1971-04-20"\n"Sidney Walker","male","Scottsville, KS","1987-01-05"\n"Guillermo Gross","male","Del Rey Oaks, RI","1998-05-31"\n"Daniel Steele","male","Martins Corner, TX","1963-07-09"\n"Brett Jimenez","male","East Waterford, ME","1958-05-06"\n
